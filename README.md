Welcome to Out of Network! ðŸ‘‹

This project is a true work in progressâ€”an experiment in building a privacy-first, AI-powered healthcare transparency tool. Weâ€™re just getting started and honestly, this may never see the light of day. But weâ€™re committed to putting in the work, one small step at a time, to find out whatâ€™s possible.

If youâ€™re curious, stick around. If youâ€™d like to contribute or just cheer us on, youâ€™re more than welcome here. Either way, thanks for stopping by. Letâ€™s see where this goes.
